                <li>The Great Barrier Reef of Australia passed away after a long illness. It was 25 million
                    years
                    old.</li>
                <li>For most of its life, the reef was the world's largest living structure, and the only one
                    visible from space. </li>
                <li> Among its many other achievements, the reef was home to one of the world’s largest
                    populations
                    of dugong and the largest breeding ground of green turtles. </li>
                <li>The reef was born on the eastern coast of the continent of Australia during the Miocene
                    epoch.
                    Its first 24.99 million years were seemingly happy ones, marked by overall growth. It was
                    formed
                    by corals, which are tiny anemone-like animals that secrete shell to form colonies of
                    millions
                    of individuals. Its complex, sheltered structure came to comprise the most important habitat
                    in
                    the ocean. Its otherworldly colors and patterns will be sorely missed.</li>
                <li>To say the reef was an extremely active member of its community is an understatement. The
                    surrounding ecological community wouldn’t have existed without it.
                <li> generous spirit was immediately evident 60,000 years ago, when the first humans reached
                    Australia from Asia during a time of much lower sea levels. Aboriginal clans hunted and
                    fished
                    its waters and cays for millennia, and continued to do so right up to its demise.</li>
