                    <li>The Great Barrier Reef of Australia passed away after a long illness. It was 25 million years
                        old.</li>
                    <li>For most of its life, the reef was the world's largest living structure, and the only one
                        visible from space. </li>
                    <li> Among its many other achievements, the reef was home to one of the world’s largest populations
                        of dugong and the largest breeding ground of green turtles. </li>
                    <li>The reef was born on the eastern coast of the continent of Australia during the Miocene epoch.
                        Its first 24.99 million years were seemingly happy ones, marked by overall growth. It was formed
                        by corals, which are tiny anemone-like animals that secrete shell to form colonies of millions
                        of individuals. Its complex, sheltered structure came to comprise the most important habitat in
                        the ocean. Its otherworldly colors and patterns will be sorely missed.</li>
                    <li>To say the reef was an extremely active member of its community is an understatement. The
                        surrounding ecological community wouldn’t have existed without it.
                    <li> generous spirit was immediately evident 60,000 years ago, when the first humans reached
                        Australia from Asia during a time of much lower sea levels. Aboriginal clans hunted and fished
                        its waters and cays for millennia, and continued to do so right up to its demise.</li>
