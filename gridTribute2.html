        <p>Climate change and ocean acidification have killed off one of the most spectacular features on the

            <ul>
                <li>The Great Barrier Reef of Australia passed away after a long illness. It was 25 million
                    years
                    old.</li>
                <li>For most of its life, the reef was the world's largest living structure, and the only one
                    visible from space. </li>
                <li> Among its many other achievements, the reef was home to one of the world’s largest
                    populations
                    of dugong and the largest breeding ground of green turtles. </li>
                <li>The reef was born on the eastern coast of the continent of Australia during the Miocene
                    epoch.
                    Its first 24.99 million years were seemingly happy ones, marked by overall growth.</li>
                <li>It was
                    formed
                    by corals, which are tiny anemone-like animals that secrete shell to form colonies of
                    millions
                    of individuals.</li>
                <li>Its complex, sheltered structure came to comprise the most important habitat
                    in
                    the ocean. Its otherworldly colors and patterns will be sorely missed.</li>
                <li>To say the reef was an extremely active member of its community is an understatement. The
                    surrounding ecological community wouldn’t have existed without it.
                <li> generous spirit was immediately evident 60,000 years ago, when the first humans reached
                    Australia from Asia during a time of much lower sea levels. Aboriginal clans hunted and
                    fished
                    its waters and cays for millennia, and continued to do so right up to its demise.</li>
